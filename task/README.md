i have made a function with the name of fees and give a parameter
store the function into a variable with the name of fee
</li>
<li>
as the previous function gives return value in it we have another function  
now we will give argument to the variable with the name of fee as he stroed function
</li>
<li>
inoreder to call that function we have made an other variable with the name of p now again it contain return having an other function in it 
</li>
<li>
so we have to again give the arguments to p now in p we have last function which returns the value
